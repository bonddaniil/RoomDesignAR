# Tumba Project

Tumba is a mobile application for interior design visualization using augmented reality (AR) technology. The app allows users to place, customize, and interact with 3D furniture models in their real-world environment using the device's camera.

## Key Features

- Placement of 3D furniture models in real space.
- Scaling, rotating, and moving objects within the scene.
- Intuitive user interface for easy model manipulation.
- Global changes of textures and materials.
- Creating own materials for models.
- Support for Android and iOS thanks to Unity and AR Foundation.

## Technologies

- Unity — the game engine used to build the application.
- AR Foundation — a unified tool for working with ARKit (iOS) and ARCore (Android).

## Project Goal

The project aims to create an intuitive and accessible tool for users who want to design and modify their interior spaces using a mobile device.
